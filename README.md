## Word Of The Day Widget

[Word Of The Day Widget](Word-Of-The-Day-Widget.js)

This is a small widget that shows today’s word of the day. The word is grabbed from https://www.merriam-webster.com/word-of-the-day/. The definitions will have a chance not to work.

If you see “➤” in a definition than the following word is a synonym of the previous definition.
