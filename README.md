## Word Of The Day Widget

[Word Of The Day Widget](Word-Of-The-Day-Widget.js)

This is a small widget that shows today’s word of the day. The word is grabbed from https://www.merriam-webster.com/word-of-the-day/. The definitions will have a chance not to work. So far all of the words have worked but since all of the definitions are formatted differently they could be a bit messed up. If you see “➤” in a definition than the following word is a synonym of the previous definition.

* Can easily change text colours and background colour
* Different colours can be active if dark mode is on or if light mode is on
* Shows the type of word, pronunciation and syllables, as well as the definition
